Description: This dataset came from Kaggle and titled [US Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset). In this dataset has health insurance premium charges and other variables related to life style and health. For example, bmi, number of children, region of care, etc. We chose this topic because of how unique healthcare prices are in the United States. We chose this dataset because the techniques used for exploring the data and modeling can be used on other health insurance datasets, beyond the scope of this project.

This is the final project of the UC Berkeley Stat 159/259 class taught in Spring 2023.
